In this repository, you will find four different files:

- **Table S1**: contains a table with the hospitals sorted according to MINSAL categorisations and proposed partitions, using Euclidean or Pearson's correlation distances.

- **Figure S1**: a figure that corresponds to the magnitude of the healthcare production features collected during 2016, grouped according to the modified MINSAL categorisation. The median values have been coloured blue. ![Figure S1](Figure S1.png)

- **Figure S2**: a figure that corresponds to the magnitude of the healthcare production features collected during 2016, grouped according to consensus partition solution based on Pearson's correlation distance. The median values have been coloured blue. ![Figure S2](Figure S2.png)

- **Algorithm S1**: Non-dominated Sorting Genetic Algorithm-II. ![Algorithm S1](Algorithm S1.png)

- **Appendix S1**: contains all the data mentioned above.
